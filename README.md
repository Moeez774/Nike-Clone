A Nike clone which contains 15 pages for now including 8 product pages and 1 sign-up page.

Everything in this clone for now is probably same like Nike's site, from navbar to search bar, from search bar to footer and homepage. This is my part time project so I'll keep adding more pages to it and will make it completely like Nike's site.

Programming languages used:

1.Typescript
2.Nextjs ( Framework of Reactjs )

In backend it used Nextjs API routes for fetching json data.

Used Amazon S3 to store photos of products.
